This blog post explaines the paper *'DGM: A deep learning algorithm for solving partial differential equations'* by Justin Sirignano and Konstantinos Spiliopoulos, published in 2018.

Second paragraph.

## Introduction

- PDEs, Motivation
- Usual approaches, problems with high number of dimensions
- New approach with Deep Learning
- Galerkin Method -> Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) 

## The algorithm

- Define PDE
- Define deep neural network $$\theta$$
- Algorithm:
  - Draw random points $$s_n$$
  - Define error function $$G(\theta_n, s_n)$$
