Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) play a crucial role in modeling various phenomena in physics, engineering, and finance. Solving high-dimensional PDEs has been a longstanding computational challenge, with traditional methods becoming impractical due to the explosion in the number of grid points and the demand for reduced time step size. In this blog post, we explore the approach from the paper *'DGM: A deep learning algorithm for solving partial differential equations'* by Justin Sirignano and Konstantinos Spiliopoulos, published in 2018 called the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) that leverages deep learning to efficiently solve high-dimensional PDEs. 

## TL;DR
High-dimensional PDEs, with multiple spatial dimensions, pose a computational challenge due to the impracticality of using traditional finite difference methods. The mesh size grows exponentially with the number of dimensions, making it computationally intractable. The paper proposes a mesh-free approach using deep neural networks to approximate solutions, mitigating the challenges associated with traditional methods.

The Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) is a mesh-free algorithm inspired by the Galerkin method, a widely-used computational technique for solving PDEs. However, instead of representing the solution as a linear combination of basis functions, DGM employs a deep neural network. The neural network is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial conditions, and boundary conditions using stochastic gradient descent on randomly sampled spatial points.

The authors present promising numerical results for DGM on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, demonstrating its accuracy in solving problems up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation, showcasing its versatility and robustness.

To address the computational cost associated with calculating second derivatives in higher dimensions, the paper introduces a modified algorithm using a Monte Carlo method. This approach significantly reduces computational expenses while introducing some bias and variance. The trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy is carefully considered.

In conclusion, by combining insights from machine learning and numerical methods, the Deep Galerkin Method opens new possibilities for tackling complex high-dimensional PDEs in various scientific and engineering domains.

## Partial Differential Equations
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) stand as the backbone of mathematical modeling, governing phenomena from heat transfer and fluid dynamics to quantum mechanics. These intricate mathematical entities have been pivotal in our quest to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems.

Partial Differential Equations involve functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives. They play a pivotal role in describing how physical quantities vary with respect to multiple independent variables, such as space and time. The general form of a PDE can be expressed as:

$$F(t, x_1, ..., x_n, u, \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}, ..., \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n}, \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_{1}^2}, ..., \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_{n}^2},...) = 0$$

### Significance of PDEs
