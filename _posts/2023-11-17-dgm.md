This blog post explaines the paper *'DGM: A deep learning algorithm for solving partial differential equations'* by Justin Sirignano and Konstantinos Spiliopoulos, published in 2018.

Second paragraph. Draft Version.

## Introduction

- PDEs, Motivation
- Usual approaches, problems with high number of dimensions
- New approach with Deep Learning
- Galerkin Method -> Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) 

## The algorithm

- Define (general) PDE
- Define deep neural network with parameters $$\theta$$
- Algorithm:
  - Draw random points $$s_n$$
  - Define error function $$G(\theta_n, s_n)$$
  - Take descent steps until convergence: $$\theta_{n+1}= \theta_{n} - \alpha_n \nabla_{\theta}G(\theta_n, s_n)$$

- Show correctness

### Monte Carlo 2nd derivatives

- Problem with computation of second derivatives
- Describe Monte Carlo approach for fast computation of 2nd derivatives
